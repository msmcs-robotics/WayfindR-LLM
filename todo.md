yes and i guess i would like to have a chat on the dashboard where a user can ask for reports on the system or ask questions about agents and then also manually move agents to different locations or tell agents to say thing or perform other actions. doe sthis make sense? make sure this type of chat is different from agents as this will be an "operator" chat where the operator can interact with the system and manage agents, but the LLM does not tell the operator to go to waypoints or perform actions or anything like that. it's more of a management tool for the operator to interact with the system and manage agents.
