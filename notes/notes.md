I have the following old python script rag_store.py that I want to make a new version using the hybrid scalable version discussed in the attatched README.md. I have also attatched a demo of how to use lightRAG with OLLAMA and lightRAG with ollama and neo4j. I have also attatched my project's docker compose file. Please return a script to handle the hybrid system of postgreSQL and Qdrant with necessary plugins. I want to make sure that telemetry data is specifically sent to Qdrant and that agent relationships and MCP message chains are specifically sent to PostgreSQL.

So how does it know if the data being passed to add_log is messages on the MCP or agent telemetry, can i refactor the code so that I have a function specifically to add agent telemetry (add_telemetry) to qdrant and then a function to add mcp messages (add_mcp_messages)

> need to fix submodle - have a link file to 7-mature_RAG/LighRAG or move LightRAG to the parent folder of this repo bc cannot have a copy of a submodule? or cannot copy directory? double check



I have implemented a new hybrid RAG setup in among the following files. I want to update the frontend of my webchat to display 2 feeds, "QDRANT Feed" and "PostgreSQL Feed", for styline, divide the web page in 3 sections so that the qdrant feed is 1, same with postgresfeed and the chat itself. use the following get_logs script as a reference for QDRANT. I have also attatched my old scripts.


I just updated my RAG to a hybrid model - qdrant for telemetry, postgreSQL for chat messages and any possible needed agent relationships. I want to update my chatapp to properly handle the new RAG for postgresql / messages logging. I have attatched my current (old) chatapp, old rag script, and new rag script that i need my chatapp to now work with without changing the funcitonality of getting and sending messages to the frontend chat.


now I want to make sure to record the LLM response in RAG and then display in chatapp


LightRAG is not being implemented, how to actually use lightRAG?


I am trying to make a backend linux server that iwll run an LLM to help interpret what is going on to enable a robot that greets people and provides guidance through a building. I will have an android app that interfaces with a user and sends user input in hte form of a string to a chatapp api url and then those chat messages will be stored in postgresql. I am using qdrant database to collect telemetry from the robot's sensors such as lidar, and MPU, and wheel encoders. I am wondering how much telemetry i should keep locally on the raspberry pi on the robot and how much i should share to the llm that would be relevant. the llm will not be making low level decisions on movements but rather decisions on when and how to navigate to given waypoints in a system. sensor data collected will be the following:

- lidar information
- IMU data
- wheel encoders
- ultrasonic sensors

i'm thinking i don't need to send raw data from the ultrasonic sensors, wheel encoders, imu raw  data, or even raw lidar data, but rather perform simple calculations onboard the pi to provide better context in the telemetry such as the following

- timestamp from robot
- expected position (x,y)
- movement speed
- expected distance traveled
- crashed or not crashed (unsure how to navigate from current position)

the idea is to use the chat messages and the refactored telemetry to enable the llm to handle both user interaction while also handling telling the robot to move to a position or not. I want to give a series of functions for the model context protocol to be able to tell the robot such as navigate(waypoint name) or to multiple waypoints such as nav_points([way1, way2, way3]. 

please provide a good overview in markdown format all in a markdown codeblock on how to integrate this hybrid storage solution into my LLM system. explain how sensor telemetry is collected, how the MCP will handle conversations with the user, how the RAG will build context for the LLM responses, how the MCP needs to coach the llm to understand what a user wants and if they want navigation make a function call, and how the robot might be able to send basic messages to the LLM to prompt function calls such as "Robot1 stuck, need to move to Way2" and the llm will select a function call that will help the robot get unstuck. 

beware of using codeblocks in your response as they might break the markdown codeblock.

please start by making rag_store.py code to handle the proper number of arguments for each database and create an endpoint in the chatapp to handle telemetry. I don't want to send telemetry straight to the chat, just forward it to the database. then the rag_store script will use the telemetry from qdrant to add context to conversations. then please make a basic script for sending sample telemetry to the chatapp.
