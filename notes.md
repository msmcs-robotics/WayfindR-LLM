I have the following old python script rag_store.py that I want to make a new version using the hybrid scalable version discussed in the attatched README.md. I have also attatched a demo of how to use lightRAG with OLLAMA and lightRAG with ollama and neo4j. I have also attatched my project's docker compose file. Please return a script to handle the hybrid system of postgreSQL and Qdrant with necessary plugins. I want to make sure that telemetry data is specifically sent to Qdrant and that agent relationships and MCP message chains are specifically sent to PostgreSQL.

So how does it know if the data being passed to add_log is messages on the MCP or agent telemetry, can i refactor the code so that I have a function specifically to add agent telemetry (add_telemetry) to qdrant and then a function to add mcp messages (add_mcp_messages)

> need to fix submodle - have a link file to 7-mature_RAG/LighRAG or move LightRAG to the parent folder of this repo bc cannot have a copy of a submodule? or cannot copy directory? double check



I have implemented a new hybrid RAG setup in among the following files. I want to update the frontend of my webchat to display 2 feeds, "QDRANT Feed" and "PostgreSQL Feed", for styline, divide the web page in 3 sections so that the qdrant feed is 1, same with postgresfeed and the chat itself. use the following get_logs script as a reference for QDRANT. I have also attatched my old scripts.


I just updated my RAG to a hybrid model - qdrant for telemetry, postgreSQL for chat messages and any possible needed agent relationships. I want to update my chatapp to properly handle the new RAG for postgresql / messages logging. I have attatched my current (old) chatapp, old rag script, and new rag script that i need my chatapp to now work with without changing the funcitonality of getting and sending messages to the frontend chat.


now I want to make sure to record the LLM response in RAG and then display in chatapp


LightRAG is not being implemented, how to actually use lightRAG?
